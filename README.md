# wow_i18n_rails

Autoloads the translations from the [wow_i18n](https://www.github.com/promisedlandt/wow_i18n_rails) gem into Ruby on Rails.

# Usage

In your Rails application, simply add 

`gem "wow_i18n_rails"`

to your Gemfile and bundle install.  
The translations will be loaded automatically.

If you have explicity set `I18n.available_locales`, only the translations for those locales will be loaded.

# Contributing

If you would like to add / change translations, don't do it here, do it in the [wow_i18n](https://www.github.com/promisedlandt/wow_i18n_rails) gem.
